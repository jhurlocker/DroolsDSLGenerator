# DroolsDSLGenerator
Tool to generate basic DSL statements using reflection on an existing fact model

Not fully functional and needs work.
- No consequence statements are generated in initial version.
- Should generate a .dsl file instead of printing to console.
- Need to add DSL validation after the file is generated.
